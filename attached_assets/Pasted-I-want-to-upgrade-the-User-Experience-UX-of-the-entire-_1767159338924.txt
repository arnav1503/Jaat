I want to upgrade the User Experience (UX) of the entire application to be best-in-class.

Role: Act as a Senior Frontend Engineer and UX Specialist. Constraint: Do not change the visual style (colors/branding), but you MUST improve the interaction design and usability.

Please scan all templates and JavaScript files to implement the following 5 Pillars of Great UX:

1. The "100ms Rule" (Instant Feedback)

Interaction: Users must feel an immediate response to every click.

Task: Add a Loading State to ALL buttons that submit forms or fetch data.

Behavior: On click, immediately disable the button and change text to "Processing..." or show a spinner.

Goal: Prevent double-submissions and reassure the user the app is working.

2. Non-Blocking Notifications (Toast System)

Interaction: Stop using browser alert() or static text for messages.

Task: Implement a Toast Notification System (slide-in messages at the top-right or bottom-center).

Behavior: Flash messages (Success/Error) should appear automatically, stay for 3-5 seconds, and then fade out without requiring a user click to dismiss.

3. Frictionless Forms (Smart Inputs)

Interaction: Typing should be effortless.

Task: Optimize all login and data entry forms:

Add autofocus to the first input field of every form (e.g., focus 'Email' on page load).

Ensure the Enter key submits the form (fix any buttons that are type="button" instead of type="submit").

Add autocomplete attributes (e.g., autocomplete="username" or autocomplete="current-password") so browsers can help fill details.

4. Empty State Management

Interaction: Never show a blank screen or empty table.

Task: Update all Jinja2 loops (lists of orders, students, staff).

Logic: Use {% else %} in loops to render a friendly "No items found" block with a call-to-action button (e.g., "Create your first order").

5. "Escape Hatches" (Navigation)

Interaction: Users should never feel trapped.

Task: Ensure every sub-page (like 'Edit Profile' or 'View Details') has a clearly visible "Back" button or breadcrumb link at the top to return to the dashboard.

Custom Error Pages:

Create friendly 404.html (Page Not Found) and 500.html (Server Error) templates so users never see a raw code error. Include a button to go back Home.

Apply these changes globally across the codebase.
